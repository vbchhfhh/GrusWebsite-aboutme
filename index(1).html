    <h1>About Gru</h1>
    <p class="gg"><strong>Ah, well, you see, it all started with a curious twinkle in my eye and a desire for scientific exploration. I, Gru, embarked on a series of rather unusual experiments, all in the name of progress, of course. My intention was simply to push the boundaries of knowledge and innovation. Whether it was attempting to shrink the moon for a more convenient parking spot or creating a fluffy unicorn that pooped ice cream, I truly believed I was contributing to the greater good of humanity. After all, every scientist encounters a few bumps on the road to brilliance, and I was no exception.

        In my free time, which I tried to evenly distribute despite my busy schedule, I enjoyed spending moments with my three lovely adopted daughters, Agnes, Edith, and Margo. We'd indulge in fun activities like going to theme parks, attempting to bake cookies (often with comical results), and watching movies in our cozy living room. These precious moments reminded me of the joys of parenthood and added balance to my life.
        
        Of course, I couldn't resist the occasional dance-off with my minions in the </strong>living room, showcasing some impressive moves, or engaging in a friendly prank war with my arch-nemesis, Vector. All these activities, both scientific and personal, were part of what made life as Gru an exciting and unpredictable adventure.</p>
